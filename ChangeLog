*  BUG ID 10:

Bug reported by: st xiao
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/supersonic-query-engine/UPqZLCuHxE0

Features:
* Significant cleanup of dependencies:
GOOD news: Supersonic builds on OSX and should be much easier to build it on other
systems.
BAD news:  C++0x compatible compiler is required (e.g. >=gcc-4.6).
* Added support for enums to Supersonic:
* adds core support for the enum type, that consists of (id, value) pairs.
* adds support for parsing enums (by name) from strings.
* adds support for printing enums to strings (when dumping views for
debugging and testing).
* Extended aggegation support: Adding the functionality for limiting number of
rows in the result by giving a bound on the unique number of key rows seen in
input order. All the key combinations which doesn't fall in this bound get
aggregated in one single row at last hash index.
Affected APIs:
supersonic/cursor/core/aggregate.h
supersonic/cursor/infrastructure/row_hash_set.h
* Fixed potential undefined-behaviour issue in:
supersonic/expression/core/elementary_bound_expressions.cc
* Fixed bug in supersonic/expression/core/elementary_bound_expressions.cc
* hash-join optimization: for empty left-hand-side, don't scan the
right-hand-side.
* Fixed Permutation::permutation() behavior in case of empty permutation.
